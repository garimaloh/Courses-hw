We will use Bowtie 2 to build an index, and then align reads to that index.  You will learn how to build indices on genomes and how to align reads to those genomes.  You will also learn how to view the alignment results using samtools. This lab is based on the tutorial for bowtie2, on the bowtie website.\n",

Indices are used by Bowtie for memory compression and to speed up searching through the genome.  Let’s create and initialize an index on the genome of a lambda phage.\n",

    "Now that we have an index, we can use the index to align reads against our genome. We will stay in the `lambda_phage_example` directory for the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies are often provided in [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format). There are example FASTQ formatted files with short reads from the lambda phage genome in the archive you uploaded to enggrid. Briefly look at the format of one of these files using the following command:\n",

    "   `head reads/reads_1.fq`\n",

    "   You don't need to understand all the contents of this file for this lab, but if you are curious the [FASTQ Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) is a good reference.\n",

    "1. We are now going to align the reads from this file against the reference we just built. Run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   `bowtie2 -x index/lambda_virus -U reads/reads_1.fq -S lp1.sam`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You should see some output from running this command. The `-x` option tells bowtie the path to the index to use. `-U` tells it to use unpaired reads, and gives the name of the file the reads are in, and `-S lp1.sam` tells it to write the alignments to the file `lp1.sam` in [SAM format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Run the command `head lp1.sam` to see the beginning of the file. This file is in SAM format - we will learn how to interpret SAM files later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are two types of sequencing reads - single-end and paired-end. In the sequencing sample prep protocol, the DNA to be sequenced is sheared into short fragments, usually of 300-500nt. Single-end sequencing produces the sequence of only one end these fragments, while paired-end sequencing produces the sequence from both ends of the fragments. The sequences from paired-end datasets are stored in two different files that have the same number of reads in each, where the first read in each file form a mated pair of sequences originating from the same fragment, the second read in each file form a mated pair for another fragment, and so on.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The file `reads_1.fq` from above is actually one of the files from a paired-end sequencing experiment, and an additional file `reads_2.fq` is also in the examples directory. Use the following to read the usage information for `bowtie2`:\n",

Each alignment line has 11 mandatory fields for essential alignment information such as mapping position, and variable number of optional fields for flexible or aligner specific information.\n",
